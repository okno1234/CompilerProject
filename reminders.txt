We need:
    1) A folder containing test cases for errors only associated with procedures and           calls
    2) Put everything in .zip file and submit that
    3) DO NOT print the symbol table because you may opt for the deletion algorithm for        symbol table management
    4) input_file.txt: Use this to test any grading test cases
       -100 for not using "input_file.txt" as a command line argument
